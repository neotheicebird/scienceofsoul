The keystone of science is the truth that under known conditions an action has predicatable effects on a system. The universe isn't all random, rather it behaves intelligently. So I see that the choices I take in this universe and their effects are related. I make choices and observe the effects, 
it helps me make better ones, and who doesn't want to make better choices?

**Scienceofsoul** is about, why my existence? I scientifically explore the mysteries of my life, 
I have to give it to you here, it's going to be a bit subjective unlike pure sciences which kinda looks a bit more objective, 
But I think that deep down, you and me, we are one and if you apply these findings, 
you should get the same results in your life. Just test it, if they get you different results, you disprove my theories and I would be happy if you can correct me. 
We are doing science, it happens in science all the time.

I am Prashanth, I live in Chennai, India. I do programming, I teach science to high school kids and I am inspired to live.
