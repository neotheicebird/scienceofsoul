Science of Soul
---------------

This blog is about, why my existence? I scientifically explore the mysteries of my life, 
I have to give it to you here, it's going to be a bit subjective unlike pure sciences which kinda looks a bit more objective, 
But I think that deep down, you and me, we are one and if you apply these findings, 
you should get the same results in your life. Just test it, if they get you different results, you disprove my theories and I would be happy if you can correct me. 
We are doing science, it happens in science all the time.

I am Prashanth, I live in Chennai, India. I do programming, I teach science to high school kids and I am inspired to live.

This blog is inspired by [zenhabits](http://zenhabits.net) and following Leo's footsteps I uncopyright this blog.
