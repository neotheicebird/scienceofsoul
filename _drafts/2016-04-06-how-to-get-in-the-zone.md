When we are in zone we dance through our work, poetry flows, we dodge bullets, people get attracted and life just happens!

We all know that feeling of this light weight existence, that which we sometimes stumble upon. But why can't we be in the zone all the time? Is it just the day? Or do we need luck? or can we tap into this state using some tools I have?!

I set myself up to solve this puzzle quite often, in fact this is the only passionate thing I have gritfully done since my childhood. Asking myself often, how to flow? With all my attempts to flow, what I have learned is that this isn't a solve once for all life problem, one reason being our lives is continuously moving, things keep changing and I am stuck with a method I found out. So mostly, I solve the puzzle, enjoy its reward briefly, soon the puzzle gets all scrambled again, I go through a bad time, I realize I am going through a dark patch which I can consciously change and I set myself up to solve it again. That's the cycle. I am sure you go through this too.

I am getting a hang of this game now and the frequency of falling into the zone has increased. Here's few pointers that help me overcome what stops my flow quickly:

## 1. Greed

Ever noticed how the greedy don't often get lucky? ok, that's a lame question. "Greedy go unlucky" is the plot line of most children stories! better question now, do you understand greed, so that you can keep away from it?

Greedy people are mostly miserable, there is some mechanism that work inbetween greed and misery, making them corelated. We are not greedy like Scrooge McDuck, fair enough, but even for saner folks like us greed works in subtle ways and lurks through us without us noticing. Examples:
    * Food's tasty? we overeat
    * 
    * The greed in me now is, I wish you are reading this post thinking, "wow! this guys on fire!" But we both know what the truth is. :D
