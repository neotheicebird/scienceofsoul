*__Disciple__*: Master, what is the secret to a happy life?

*__Master__*: Dear one, to be happy you need to love oneself and others unconditionally.

*__Disciple__*: cool! Is that the only condition? That's easy to remember.

*__Master (thinking)__*: 'Unconditional' isn't a concept, so how can words express it? The mind can never grasp it, its tool can never express it.

*__Master__*: Fancy a game of yamack?

*__Disciple__*: yamackaroozey! Am ready.
