Disciple: Master, what is the worst disease that can affect me?

Master: My dear, the worst disease you can have is something called "I know".

Disciple: Oh, then what cures it?

Master: I don't know!

Disciple: Don't worry master, I will find that cure and help anyone who's affected.

Master: I bet that you will. Work hard.
