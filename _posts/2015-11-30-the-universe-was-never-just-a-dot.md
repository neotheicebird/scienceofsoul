The universe is expanding, galaxies are moving away from each other faster than the speed of light and is ever accelerating, the observable universe is shrinking in a way, as more galaxies move out of the cosmological horizon each second and in due course of time will leave our galaxy all alone, which means there isn't going to be as many stars in the night skies as we find today! or atleast galaxies that we think are stars will be blinded from our sight. 

knowing these facts or even without knowing them, it is easy to think that all this infinite matter-energy in space-time called 'the universe', tracing back in time, should have taken birth in a condensed form as an infinitesimal, meeky little dot somewhere far away in empty space. When time started, the universe started out as just a dot, but with a bang it started creating matter and energy out of nothingness. Now this is a nice picture painted in our minds by science fiction and common sense.
 
But is this true? 

<p class="message">
Was the universe just a dot?
</p>

Let's do a thought experiment and see if we can find out the truth! 

*Caution: wear goggles to protect your eyes, or you might be blinded by sheer awesomeness! :P*

**The Big Bang Thought Experiment**

Imagine the universe, that all pervasive matter and energy as a tiny blob in space. You should be thinking of a spec of light in a never ending black canvas.

Seems like a dot universe is possible, isn't it? Let's put it to test.

**Test No: 1**

<p class="message">
In your imagination, who/what is the observer? 
</p>

Adding in clarity, if this event had to be really observed, what in the world is capable of observing it?

It might be you, the human being, or it might be a camera or the observer is some fancy scientific device, like a spectroscope.

This test passes, as there are instruments capable of detecting such an early universe as it sprays energy out.

**Test No: 2**

<p class="message">
To make a valid measurement, where should the observer be placed to observe this grand phenomenon, the tiniest universe?
</p>

Somewhere away from the dot, like a few millimeters or few million light years depending on the sensitivity of the instrument at hand. Hmmm... Something is odd. 

Do you see the point? Not the point sized pixel of light, but the point I am trying to make.

This test would instantly fail the hypothesis at hand!

Here's why. Any observer is made of matter. To measure anything, we need a *thing* like a ruler, a balance, a stop watch, or in this case a camera or a spectroscope.

<p class="message">
But by separating the observer from the observed, we have already expanded the universe.
</p>

Eureka! The universe is actually a tiny blob of infinite matter-energy plus a camera!

Is this the only scenario, aren't there any alternates?

<p class="message">
Can't the observer be somewhere inside and still observe the universe taking birth?
</p>

Let's put the observer inside the universe. Being a fraction of the tiny universe, the observer should be tinier than the universe itself, to observe anything about the universe. Like *How our telescopes and our eyes are smaller compared to the magnificent cosmos that we see*.

But, **if the observer can be a smaller part of a *dot sized* universe, we can't call the universe a dot anymore.** Makes sense right? In this case, the universe can be considered already expanded so that it is larger than the observer\.

Basically, larger than a dot is not dot enough. :D

**The final case:**
Here comes the final question

<p class="message">
Couldn't the universe have been a dot and there be no observer to observe it?

Why should there be an observer anyway?
</p>

That's because, without any observers, **there is simply no way to measure such an universe**. We are dealing with the **immeasurable** here, to call the immeasurable to be a dot is plain absurd!
 
And this also leads to a classic philosophical thought experiment:

<p class="message">
If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
</p>

or a funny version by Dr.Ken Robinson in [Do schools kill creativity](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity), where he states:

<p class="message">
If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?
</p>

That sure is funny, but anyway, along the same lines, if there couldn't have been any observer whatsoever to observe such a phenomenon, as we can conclude from our experiment, did the phenomenon really happen the way we think it happened?

I am not claiming, [The Big Bang Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) is wrong. No, there is a lot of evidence for the Big Bang to have happened, like that cracking noise old televisions made, that's the signal got from the Big Bang! I am simply stating that popular science ideas like *'the universe was just a dot'* has stuck with many of us, and we may not have given enough thought to it. **By believing what we hear or see without doubt, we support untested beliefs, and such beliefs bind freedom**. Think about it, it was little bit of heavy lifting for me, but it was fun cracking the truth of it.
 
Here's some fun stuff, to understand **The Big Bang theory** as scientists currently do watch the video [Science, Religion, and the Big Bang](https://youtu.be/q3MWRvLndzs) by [Minute Physics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHW94eEFW7hkUMVaZz4eDg), in which he shows evidence that not only disproves the *'dot model'*, but also tell us *'How the universe freaking looked when Big Bang took place'*
 
**Now that's awesome**

I like to end articles with questions. Every answer most often leads to a better question, in that spirit here are two untested hypothesis, truth of which I would love to discover with you:

1 - Every moment we measure reality, right? like we measure heat, light, sound, gravitational pull and so on and respond to these stimuli. That's what living is all about, measuring and responding. Without measurement there is no living. 
Hypothesis:

<p class="message">
In a dream, we measure and respond, there are a lot of stimulus of its own kind, like maybe we fly, we might experience breeze and heat. We are still bound by some rules.
A) Is a dream just an alternate universe/alternate reality?
B) If not, what is that which separates the so called 'reality' from a 'dream'. 
'I feel it' is valid, but to get an intellectual proof is a nice challenge to solve.
</p>

2 - We kinda agree that without anyone to observe an event, to talk about if that event happened or not is absurd. Let's assume, for a moment, that without an observer, the event to be observed, doesn't happen! Which leads to the following hypothesis:

<p class="message">
Without you, the observer, there is no universe! Which could also mean, the universe exists because you exist, Which could also 'beautifully' mean, that you are the universe, if there cannot be existence of one without the other then they are two projections of the same thing!
</p>

But like Dr.Richard Feynman says an hypothesis, however beautiful it may sound to you, if experiments disagree with it, then it is wrong! 

Our work here is to find ways to test our beliefs and then test them! only after we test should we believe (realize) them. 

**Happy thinking!**
