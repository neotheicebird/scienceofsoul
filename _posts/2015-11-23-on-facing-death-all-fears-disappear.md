That's it. The title says it all. OK, for you I will explain the obvious.

As Steve Jobs famously said ([here](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc)), sometimes when I look into the mirror, I see a mortal being.

I know that this is a tough one, because the idea of death has scared us for long, because **all fear arises from the fear of death**. But if I dare to see this fact and realize that this being as I know it, with friends and foes (mostly friends), a being of many many relationships, a being with arms and legs, moving freely, looking at the world through its colourful eyes, **if I realize that this being will end**, if I let this fact sink in deep into my blood and bones, then, something unbelievable takes place, something humbling.

All kinds of fear end, all the fake, learnt purposes of life disappears, leaving behind a truer, beautiful, and meaningful heart. Death is a reminder that this is all a game, that this life is just the playground. This reminder is love that is rich, and incorruptible.

It is tough to face the idea of death, but I choose to face it now and be free of its bonds, to be like the day I was born, like those days before this world taught me to live with an illusion.

This one cannot be practised, its more like a realization that hits us. There you go, I am hitting you with it right now, *'You would have to die someday'*.
